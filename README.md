# advent-of-code-24
Welcome to my solutions for Advent of Code 2024. All solutions are written in Python and presented in notebooks. I am using this as an opportunity to improve my Python practices therefore I am aiming for my solutions to be as efficient as possible (within my abilities). Please reach out to me via email (BenJones1479@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjonesdata/) if you wish to discuss!
